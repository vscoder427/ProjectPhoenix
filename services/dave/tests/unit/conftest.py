Unit test configuration.

This conftest.py provides unit test specific fixtures.
Unit tests should be fast (<100ms) and have no external dependencies.

# Unit tests should be isolated - no database fixtures here
# Import factories for test data generation
# Import mocks for external services

# Example: If you need a specific mock for all unit tests
# in a subdirectory, define it here
