# Secrets Access Policy

This standard defines who can access secrets and how.

## Access Control

- Secrets accessible only by service accounts
- Human access requires approval

## Audit

- All secret access is logged
- Quarterly access reviews required
- Tie access review findings and temporary human access approvals into the release readiness checklist so deployments reflect the current secret posture.
