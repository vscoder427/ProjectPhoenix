# Vendor Management Standard

This standard defines vendor risk and BAA management.

## BAA Inventory

- Maintain a vendor BAA inventory with renewal dates
- No PHI in systems without BAA

## Risk Review

- Annual vendor risk review
- Document changes in vendor scope or data access

## Offboarding

- Ensure data deletion on vendor termination
- Sync vendor changes, BAAs, and risk reviews to the [HIPAA BAA Readiness Checklist](hipaa-baa-readiness.md) and the release readiness notes for any deploy that touches vendor integrations.
