# Config Change Management

This standard defines how configuration changes are reviewed and deployed.

## Approval

- Config changes require review and approval
- Production changes require manual approval
- Release readiness checklist must list config changes that go out with the release so deploy reviewers can re-approve staging-to-prod transitions.

## Audit

- Log all config changes with timestamps
- Track who made the change and why
