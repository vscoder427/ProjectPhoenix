# Formatting, Linting, and Typing Standard

This standard defines code quality tooling for all Python services.

## Formatter

- Ruff format

## Linter

- Ruff

## Type Checker

- Pyright

## Strictness

- CI fails on lint, type errors, and coverage thresholds
- Document any tolerance or temporary overrides in the release readiness checklist so reviewers can track when formatting rules are intentionally relaxed.
