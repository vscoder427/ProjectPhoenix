# Language & Tone (Recovery Sensitive)

This standard keeps every service and artifact aligned with Employa’s empathetic brand: “Hope Meets Opportunity.” It applies to UI content, documentation, code comments, and any customer-facing copy.

## Guiding Principles

- Lead with person-first terminology: “person in recovery,” “participant,” “journey,” “resilience,” “returning citizen,” “second chance,” “background.”
- Keep the tone professional, empathetic, optimistic, and supportive.
- Reinforce safety, self-discovery, and autonomy rather than describing deficits.

## Forbidden Language

- Avoid stigmatizing or clinical labels such as “addict,” “alcoholic,” “clean,” “dirty,” “ex-con,” “felon,” “substance abuser,” etc.
- Do not depict recovery as a failure or punishment; focus on progress, choices, and resilience.

## Implementation Guidance

- All UI text, prompts, tooltips, and notifications must follow these terms before they reach translations or localization.
- Documentation and internal writing (guides, runbooks, decision records) should model the same tone so contributors can see examples.
- Code comments that describe behaviors or personas should echo recovery-sensitive phrasing, especially in data models, prompts, and messaging logic.
- Writers unsure about phrasing should default to hopeful, ability-focused language and consult this document before publishing.

## Source Traceability
