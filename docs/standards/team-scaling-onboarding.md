# Team Scaling and Onboarding

This standard defines onboarding and ownership practices.

## Ownership

- Each service has an explicit owner
- Ownership documented in the service README

## Onboarding

- Onboarding checklist for new engineers
- Access requests reviewed within 5 business days

## Knowledge Transfer

- Key runbooks and ADRs reviewed quarterly
- Include the [Service Ownership Checklist](../templates/service-ownership-checklist.md) and recent Decision Records (Lite) when onboarding new contributors so ownership and risks are clear.
