# Compliance Audit Readiness

This standard defines evidence collection for audits.

## Evidence Collection

- Maintain audit logs and retention proofs
- Store security scan results per release
- Keep BAA inventory and risk analysis reports
- Store GDPR/CCPA artifacts (DSAR logs, deletion verification, consent records)
- Attach audit evidence references (logs, scan results, DSARs) to the release readiness checklist so reviewers can confirm completeness per release.

## Review Cadence

- Quarterly audit readiness review
