This standard defines encryption requirements and key management.

## Encryption

- Encrypt data in transit (TLS)
- Encrypt data at rest for all PHI/PII stores

## KMS

- Key rotation policy documented

## Access

- Key access restricted to service accounts
- Document key rotation events and policy updates in the release readiness checklist so reviewers can confirm access control compliance.
