# Build Provenance Standard

This standard defines build provenance and attestations.

## Provenance

- Generate provenance metadata for every build
- Store provenance with release artifacts
- Verify provenance metadata is linked in the release readiness checklist so reviewers can confirm before promoting artifacts.

## Signing

- Signed container images required
- Verify signatures before production deploy
