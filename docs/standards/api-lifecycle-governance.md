# API Lifecycle Governance

This standard defines API lifecycle management and compatibility.

## Lifecycle Policy

- APIs must have explicit versioning and deprecation dates
- Maintain a compatibility matrix for active versions

## Client Compatibility

- Breaking changes require migration guides
- Deprecation window is 180 days

## Review

- API changes require design review before implementation
- Document new versions and migration guides in the release readiness checklist and service spec so users know the compatibility story during the next deploy.
